# Medicinal Leaf Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for classifying segmented medicinal leaf images using machine learning models. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Segmented Medicinal Leaf Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/riteshranjansaroj/segmented-medicinal-leaf-images) dataset. It consists of images of various medicinal leaves that have been segmented for classification purposes.

## Models Used

In this project, we evaluate three different models for classifying the medicinal leaf images:

1. **Googlenet**

2. **Vision Transformer (VIT)**

3. **Resnet-50**

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medicinal-leaf-classification.git
   cd medicinal-leaf-classification
   ```
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
3. Add path in the code files and run the models.
4. Each file is complete from loading data to testing the model.

## Results (Testing accuracy)
1. GoogleNet: 90.19%
2. VIT: 79.29%
3. Resnet-50: 61.04%
